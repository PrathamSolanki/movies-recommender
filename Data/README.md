Any dataset from the site https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ can be used.

Note: 
In case you wish to use any other dataset, please clean the data in movies.csv file before use i.e. you will have to remove the movies that have not been rated by any of the users. Also make any other necessary changes (if required), with respect to the dataset you use.

I have already done the necessary cleaning in the data I've provided. 
The original data I have used is http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip.
